# TouchController
Touch screen without the screen. Position a camera above a dark surface. Move your finger (or any object) through the area. The program will detect the location of the object and perform an action depending on the Touchable object being used. Current demos include: MousePad, VolumeSlider, and PianoKey.

## Getting Started
Anyone looking to develop with this code or run the runnable JAR should download OpenCV (see 'Built With'). To develop with this code, download JDK9 (see 'Built With'). If you omly wish to run the runnable JAR, [Java SE Runtime Environment 9](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre9-downloads-3848532.html) is sufficient.

## Built With
* [Java SE Development Kit 9](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html) - Foundation/GUI
* [OpenCV 3.4.1](https://opencv.org/releases.html) - Image processing
